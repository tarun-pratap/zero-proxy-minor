## Overview
Project Zero Proxy is an innovative attendance management system designed to simplify and automate the attendance process. It leverages modern technologies such as face recognition and geolocation to ensure accurate and efficient attendance tracking. This system includes features like real-time coordinates fetching, face recognition, and dynamic attendance marking on the teacher's portal.

## Features
Random Code Generation: Teachers generate a random code that students use to access the student portal.
Student Portal Access: Students enter the code to be directed to the student portal, where their live coordinates are fetched.
Face Recognition: A face recognition model automatically validates the student's identity.
Dynamic Attendance Marking: Attendance is marked dynamically on the teacher's portal based on the validated face and coordinates.
Geolocation Verification: Utilizes the Haversine formula to verify if the student's coordinates match the classroom coordinates.
Manual Entry: Teachers can manually mark attendance for students who do not have their phones.
##run command
